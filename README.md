# Car Data Analysis and Model Training

This repository contains a Python script for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model training on a car dataset. The script performs data encoding, scaling, visualization, and model training using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Dataset exploration
  - Data encoding
  - Data scaling
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Various visualizations

- Model Training
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Accuracy curves for model performance
  - Confusion matrix heatmaps
  - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
